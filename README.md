# Simple-Neural-Network-Design
Self-made neural network using simple just python, numpy and math. Can change the learning rate, and epoch size, and use different activation functions. However, limited to only one hidden layer and one output layer. Need to play with array size as can get errors when using the dot-plot between two different size matrices. Not optimized but a simple learning project to understand gradient descent, weights, and using a real-world application.
